# Question 1: Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, 
              between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed
              in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
# In[1]:


al=[]
for x in range(2000, 3201):
    if (x%7==0) and (x*5!=0):
        al.append(str(x))
print (','.join(al))
